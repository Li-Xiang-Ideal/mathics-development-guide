Hello, World! -- Version 2 with Help Text
-----------------------------------------

Now let us add some help to the *Hello* function so that World will
know about it. This is done in the docstring
for the *Hello* class and the markup is largely XML/HTML.


.. code-block:: python

  from mathics.builtin.base import Builtin

  class Hello2(Builtin):
    """
    <dl>
      <dt>Hello[$person$]
      <dd>Print a "Hello" message customized for $person$.

    This is an example of how Python Builtin-Symbol documentation works.
    </dl>
    """

    name = "Hello"
    def apply(person, evaluation):
      "Hello[person_String]"
          return String(f"Hello, {person.get_string_value()})!"

The return value is a bit more complicated here, so let us explain
that. The parameter *person* has type Mathics *String*. Therefore, to
use that we need to convert it to a Python value. This is done with
*person.get_string_value()*. And the the return value needs to be a
Mathics *String* so we need to convert the expanded Python string to
Mathics.


The XML tagging renders in the Django interface like this:

In the Django interace on the right-hand side, I hit the "?" button and started typing "H E L L" and that was enough for the Django to find it. Django will pick up this change without having to restart it!

This is how the text appears geting help via ``?`` in ``mathicsscript``:
