Evaluation of an Expression
===========================

In contrast to the simplicity and regularity for representing the data
for ``Expression``, evaluation of this data or expresion is a bit more
involved than conventional programming languages. I suppose this is to
be expected.

Part of the complexity revolves around the fact that the way function
method lookup works is by pattern matching the expression. Also, there
can be rule-based term-rewriting which goes on in conjunction with
method lookup.

If you have programmed in WL, aside from the the Python-syntax and
conventions used here, a lot of this should seem familiar,

If however you are not familiar with WL, but very familiar with Python
or similar languages, a lot of this can seem very mysterious at first:
functions don't get called using a traditional way where you create an
object like ``Number()`` and then instantiate a method on that, like
``+``, ``__plus__()``, or even ``Times()``.

Of course, since the underlying interpreter language *is* Python,
Python object creation and method lookup on that does happen. But it
happens in a much more roundabout way.

For Python and Object-Oriented programmers, as an analogy for the
complexity and indirectness, an Object-Oriented "method dispatch" is
analogous. In Python or any Object-Oriented programming language, when
you write ``a.b()``: there is a method lookup in the ``a`` object, so
*at runtime* the type of ``a`` has to be inspected. And after having
that, the method handle ``b`` needs to be computed. And this comes
from a class heirarchy.

Mathics and WL are not Object Oriented, so there is no such
class-hierarchy lookup.  However, as mentioned above, pattern matching
is used to decide which method of the object to call.

Function Name to Python method lookup
-------------------------------------

.. index:: Symbol, Predefined, Builtin, Expression

When an ``Expression`` has not been rewritten, the entire function
invocation in Mathics comes from the first leaf (or ``Head[]``) which
should be a ``Symbol``. In Python this will be a class some sort, such
as ``Builtin`` or ``Predefined`` or ``SympyFunction``. These classes
are described in a later section.

The remaining leaves of the ``Expression`` are the parameters to give
to an ``apply`` method.

In the simplest case, the ``evaluate()`` method is called. This is
used when a function has no parameters or arguments. In other words,
it looks like a constant or variable name, and usually is prefaced
with a ``$`. Examples here are ``$VersionNumber`` or ``$MachineName``.

Functions which take no parameters are generally subclassed off of the
``Builtin`` class.

However when a function takes parameters it method's Object class is
derived either directly indirectly from the ``Predefined`` class
rather than the ``Builtin``. To figure out which ``apply`` method in
the class object to call, each method's document string (or docstring)
is consulted. The lookup process is kicked off using the
``evaluate()`` method found in the ``Predefined`` class.

As we go along, we'll describe other conventions that are used that
are crucial in getting the interpreter work properly. But for now,
just remember that unless there is an ``evaluate()`` method, there is
a method name in a Mathics function class that begins with ``apply``,
and its docstring is used to figure out whether the leaves of the list
are applicable to that function.

Here is an example for the `Environment
<https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/Environment.html>`_
primitive taken from the code

.. code-block:: python

   class Environment(Builtin):

   def apply(self, var, evaluation):
       """Environment[var_?StringQ]"""
   ...

The ``apply()`` function above will get called when finding a
``Expression`` whose ``Head`` value is ``Environment`` and it has one
leaf or parameter which which we will call ``var``.  That leaf or
parameter should also much be a ``String`` object.

For more information describing Mathics function signatures that are
used in the ``apply`` method's docstring , see `Functions and Programs
<https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/FunctionsAndPrograms.html>`_
and `Patterns
<https://reference.wolfram.com/language/tutorial/Patterns.html>`_.

Function Name Descriptions
--------------------------

Online and printed documentation for builtin ``Environment`` comes from the docstring for ``class Environment`` if that exists.
In the example above, it was omitted. Here is what it looks like in the actual code.

.. code-block:: python

    class Environment(Builtin):
        """
        <dl>
          <dt>'Environment[$var$]'
          <dd>gives the value of an operating system environment variable.
        </dl>
        X> Environment["HOME"]
         = ...
        """

        def apply(self, var, evaluation):
        <dl>
          <dt>'Environment[$var$]'
          <dd>gives the value of an operating system environment variable.
        </dl>
        X> Environment["HOME"]
         = ...
	""""

The XML/HTML markup is used to format help nicely. "Documentation markup" elsewhere describes this markup.


Python Code for Evaluating an Expression
----------------------------------------

Building on the code shown above for parsing an expression,
here is code to evaluate an expression from a string:

.. code-block:: python

   # The below is a repeat of the parsing code...

   from mathics.core.parser import parse, SingleLineFeeder
   from mathics.core.definitions import Definitions

   definitions = Definitions(add_builtin=True)
   str_expression = "1 + 2 / 3"
   expr = parse(definitions, SingleLineFeeder(str_expression))

   # This code is new...

   from mathics.core.evaluation import Evaluation
   evaluation = Evaluation(definitions=definitions, catch_interrupt=False)
   last_result = expr.evaluate(evaluation)

   print("type", type(last_result))
   print("expr: ", last_result)

Running the above produces:

::

   type <class 'mathics.core.expression.Rational'>
   expr:  5/3

All of the above is wrapped nicely in the module ``mathics.session`` which
performs the above. So here is an equivalent program:

.. code-block:: python

    from mathics.session import session
    str_expression = "1 + 2 / 3"
    result = session.evaluate(str_expression)


Object Classes
==============

The fundamental classes that functions are built up from are described
below. Most of these classes are defined in `mathics.builtin.base
<https://github.com/mathics/Mathics/tree/master/mathics/builtin/base>`_.

.. index:: Atom

Atom Class Attributes
---------------------

Recall that an Expression to be evaluated is kind of S-expression
called and ``ExpressionList``, where each list item is either itself
an ``ExpressionList`` or an object in a class derived from ``Atom``.

The ``Atom`` class we encountered earlier when describing the nodes
that get created intially from a parse. However there are a few other
kinds of Atoms or fundamention objects that can appear in an
Evaluation list. These are

* ``CompiledCode``
* ``Image``

.. index:: Builtin, Predefined

Builtin and Predefined
----------------------

Most of the functions loaded when Mathics starts up and before any
packages are loaded are either ``Builtin`` or ``Predefined``

``Predefined`` is a subclass of ``Builtin``.

A feature of the ``Predefined`` class class is the convention that its
``evaluation()`` method looks at the docstring of methods that start
out with ``applied`` in order to figure out which method to call
