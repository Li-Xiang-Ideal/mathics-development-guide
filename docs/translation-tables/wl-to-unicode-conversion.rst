WL Unicode and Name to Standard Unicode Table
=============================================

Some WL Unicode input and output characters to not display in traditional Unicode.

Below is a mapping from WL Unicode to Unicode that more-often displays
properly on devices that handle Unicode. We only list entries here when there the two
unicode values differ.

For a listing going the other way see :ref:`Standard Unicode to WL Conversion Table`
or :ref:`Full WL Unicode and Name to Standard Unicode Table` for a full list of Unicode characters.
