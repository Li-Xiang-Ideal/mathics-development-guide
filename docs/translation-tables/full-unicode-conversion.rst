Full WL Unicode and Name to Standard Unicode Table
==================================================

Some WL Unicode input and output characters to not display in traditional Unicode.

Below is a mapping from WL Unicode to Unicode that more-often displays
properly on devices that handle Unicode.

We only list *all* entries here even when there the two unicode are the same.

For partial lists which list entries only where there is a difference, see:

* :ref:`Standard Unicode to WL Conversion Table`., or
* :ref:`WL Unicode and Name to Standard Unicode Table`.
