Find corresponding Sympy, SciPy, mpmath, or NumPy function
===========================================================


Going to a `SymPy search page <https://docs.sympy.org/latest/search.html>`_ and looking for "curl", we find this function as `sympy.vector.curl <https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/physics/quantum/tensorproduct.html>`_.

Sometimes the name will be different. For example, the mathics function ""EulerPhi" function is called "totient" in SymPy, and the Wikipedia name is "Euler's totient function".

Here things are simple though.
