Adding Builtin Function ``Curl``
================================

Having added the built-in function ``KroneckerProduct``, we move onto another built-in function, ``Curl``. In doing so, we will come across an additional aspects to consider: writing or prototyping this in Mathics3 first.

Below are the steps in order that were used to create ``Curl``

We will move faster over steps that were the same in :ref:`Adding Builtin ``Undefined``` and :ref:`Adding Builtin Function ``KroneckerProduct```. However, you'll find new kinds of issues arising in adding ``Curl``.
