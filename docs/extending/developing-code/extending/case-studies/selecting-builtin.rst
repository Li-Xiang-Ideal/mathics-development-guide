Selecting a Builtin to add
==========================

.. _selecting_a_builtin_to_add:


First, find a Builtin that hasn't been implemented. This is pretty easy. Generally you start out having a desire for a specific
function or symbol. However if not, there are github feature requests with the label `"New Builtin Function or Variable"
<https://github.com/Mathics3/mathics-core/labels/New%20Builtin%20Function%20or%20Variable>`_.

Also look for ``TODO`` at the bottom of the newer sections/modules for missing builtin functions for that particular class or function.

Below are a few examples of actual Mathics Builtins that we have added.

   :maxdepth: 1

   Undefined/index
   KroneckerProduct
   Curl


As we added these Builtins, we recorded the steps that were taken. We ordered the list below to go from the simpile to more advanced.
