Selecting Builtin to add
========================

Find a Builtin that hasn't been implemented. This is pretty
easy. Generally you start out having a desire for a specific
function. However if not, there are github feature requests with the
label `"New Builtin Function or Variable"
<https://github.com/Mathics3/mathics-core/labels/New%20Builtin%20Function%20or%20Variable>`_.

There are also TODO's at the bottom of the newer sections/modules for missing builtin functions for that particular class or function.

Here though we will select `KroneckerProduct <https://reference.wolfram.com/language/ref/KroneckerProduct.html>`_ as an example.
