Find corresponding Sympy, SciPy, mpmath, or NumpPy function
===========================================================


Going to a `SymPy search page <https://docs.sympy.org/latest/search.html>`_ and looking for "Kronecker", we find this function and learn that it is also called a `"tensor product matrix" <https://docs.sympy.org/latest/modules/physics/quantum/tensorproduct.html>`_. Knowing alternate names can sometimes be helpful in finding the corresponding Wikipedia entry. For example, the mathics function ""EulerPhi" function is called "totient" in SymPy, and the Wikipedia name is "Euiler's totient function".
